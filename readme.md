# Moist-True

This repository containes code and documentation regarding the development of the soil moisture sensor device network. There are three main directories: one for the code for the Raspberry Pi-based hub, one for the code running on each Arduino-based network sensor, and one for documents/diagrams regarding the software and hardware involved. 

This project is more of a proof of concept than a working model, as we were unable to develop a waterproof casing or power delivery systems for the device, but our plans included repurposing a solar pathway light to incorporate the solar cell and housing into the power supply and ingress protection of our device. The code has also not been tested, but it is based on several examples for the RFM69HCW module as well as the capacitive soil moisture sensor module.
